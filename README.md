## More Detailed Usage

A few notes:

+ You'll need to set your Stripe options in the RCP Payment Settings screen.
+ If you're migrating from RCP's included Stripe gateway, it's easy: just uncheck the Stripe gateway and check the Stripe Elements gateway.
+ You'll need to style the class `.rcp-stripe-elements-input` to resemble your default input style (with a border and padding).
+ You can use the `rcp_stripe_elements_form_data` filter to pass in custom options to the Elements field. More information on the available options are in [Stripe's documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe.js#element-options).
